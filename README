xosdutil is supposed to be a daemon for displaying notifications and stuff like time, uptime and
battery status using libxosd. Useful for small displays, as you can conserve space you'd normally use for
time display and similar stuff. It is controlled by writing to ~/.xosdutil/xosdutilctl.
Available commands:
	time - shows the time (currently in Czech format, working on it...)
	uptime - shows the uptime in a similar format to the uptime utility
	exit - stops the daemon

I use it by mapping commands like "echo 'time' > ~/.xosdutil/xosdutilctl" to keys (Win-C) in my XMonad
configuration.
