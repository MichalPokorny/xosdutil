xosdutil is supposed to be a daemon for displaying notifications and stuff like time, uptime and
battery status using libxosd. Useful for small displays, as you can conserve space you'd normally use for
time display and similar stuff. It is controlled by writing to ~/.xosdutil/xosdutilctl.

I use it by mapping commands like "echo 'time' > ~/.xosdutil/xosdutilctl" to keys (Win-C) in my XMonad
configuration.

The commands it responds to are specified in the configuration file (~/.xosdutil/xosdutil.cfg).
To kill it, send it the word "exit". For a configuration file example, see xosdutil.cfg.example.

Any command for xosdutil has the following:
	- a command to respond to, e.g. "time", "whats_the_time" etc. - this is what you write in the control pipe
	- a renderer to run, currently one of "time", "uptime", "battery", "exec" and "echo"
		(battery doesn't work, either :)
	- an optional duration in seconds (default: 5)
	- arguments for the renderer

The time renderer accepts the following arguments:
	- format: the string to pass to strftime

The uptime renderer doesn't accept any arguments. It just shows the uptime in the same format as the uptime command.

The exec renderer runs a command and displays its output. It has the following arguments:
	- run: the command to run

The echo renderer just displays what it's passed in the control pipe.
Example usage:
	commands = (
		{
			command = "show";
			renderer = "echo";
			duration = "1";
		}
	)

	Now whenever you write "show yadayada" into the control pipe,
	"yadayada" is displayed for 1 second.

The battery renderer doesn't even work yet.
